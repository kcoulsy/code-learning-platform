# Project 1: Linked List Implementation

Welcome to your first major C programming project! In this project, you'll build a fully functional linked list data structure from the ground up.

## What You'll Build

You'll create a dynamic linked list implementation that supports:
- **Node creation and initialization**
- **Insertion operations** (at head, tail, middle, and sorted)
- **Deletion operations** (by value, position, and bulk deletion)
- **Traversal and search** (printing, finding elements, counting)
- **Memory management** (proper cleanup, leak-free operation)
- **Comprehensive testing** (edge cases and debugging)

## Why This Project?

Linked lists are fundamental to understanding:
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Pointer manipulation
- Data structure design
- Memory management best practices

This project will solidify your understanding of these core concepts while building something practical and reusable.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into 7 steps, each building on the previous:

1. **Project Overview** - Understand the goals and requirements
2. **Node Structure** - Define and create the building blocks
3. **Insert Operations** - Add elements to your list
4. **Delete Operations** - Remove elements from your list
5. **Traversal & Search** - Navigate and query your list
6. **Memory Management** - Ensure leak-free operation
7. **Testing & Debugging** - Validate and debug your implementation

## Approach

This is a **guided project**, not a tutorial with complete solutions. Each step will:
- Explain what needs to be built
- Provide hints and partial code examples
- Give you exercises to implement on your own
- Highlight key concepts and common pitfalls

You'll learn by doing, not by copying.

## Getting Started

Good luck, and happy coding!
