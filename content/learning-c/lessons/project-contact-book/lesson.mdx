# Project 2: Contact Book Application

Welcome to your second C programming project! In this project, you'll build a complete contact book application that demonstrates modular programming, file I/O, and real-world software design principles.

## What You'll Build

A command-line contact management system that allows users to:
- Add new contacts with multiple fields (name, phone, email)
- List all contacts in a formatted display
- Search for contacts by name or other criteria
- Delete contacts from the database
- Save contacts to a file for persistence
- Load contacts automatically on startup

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:
- Design a multi-module C application from scratch
- Work with structs and dynamic memory allocation
- Implement file I/O for data persistence
- Create a clean separation of concerns using modules
- Build a user-friendly CLI interface
- Practice debugging and testing strategies

## Project Structure

This project is divided into 7 progressive steps:

1. **Project Specification** - Define requirements and features
2. **Design Phase** - Plan your architecture and data structures
3. **Contact Module** - Implement core contact data structures
4. **Storage Module** - Add file persistence capabilities
5. **UI Module** - Create the user interface and menu system
6. **Main Integration** - Bring all modules together
7. **Testing & Refinement** - Test thoroughly and improve

## Alternative: Todo List

If you prefer, you can build a todo list application instead, which follows the same architectural patterns but manages tasks instead of contacts. The concepts and skills are identical.

## Getting Started

This is a guided project, not a tutorial with complete solutions. Each step will:
- Provide clear requirements
- Offer design hints and suggestions
- Show code structure examples
- Challenge you to implement the details
- Give milestones to verify your progress

Take your time, experiment, and don't hesitate to research C documentation and examples online. Real programming involves problem-solving and resourcefulness!
