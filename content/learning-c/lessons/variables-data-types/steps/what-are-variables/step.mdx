# What are Variables?

A **variable** is a named storage location in memory that holds a value. Think of it as a labeled box where you can store data.

## Declaring Variables

In C, you must declare a variable before using it:

```c
// Syntax: type name;
int age;
float price;
char letter;
```

## Initializing Variables

You can give a variable an initial value:

```c
// Declaration with initialization
int age = 25;
float price = 19.99;
char grade = 'A';
```

## Variable Naming Rules

- Must start with a letter or underscore
- Can contain letters, digits, and underscores
- Cannot use reserved keywords (`int`, `return`, etc.)
- Case-sensitive (`Age` and `age` are different)

```c
// Good variable names
int studentCount;
float total_price;
char _initial;

// Bad variable names
// int 2ndPlace;    // Can't start with number
// float my-price;  // Can't use hyphens
// int return;      // Can't use keywords
```
