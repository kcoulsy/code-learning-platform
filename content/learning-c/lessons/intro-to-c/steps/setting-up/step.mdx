# Setting Up Your C Development Environment

Before you can start writing C programs, you need to set up your development environment with the right tools for compilation, debugging, and code formatting.

## What You Need

1. **A C Compiler** - Converts your code to machine-executable programs
2. **A Debugger** - Helps you find and fix bugs
3. **A Code Formatter** - Maintains consistent code style
4. **A Text Editor or IDE** - Where you write your code
5. **Terminal/Command Line** - To compile and run programs

## Installing GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

GCC is the most widely used C compiler and is the standard for this course.

### On Linux
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential

# Fedora
sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ make

# Verify installation
gcc --version
```

### On macOS
```bash
# Install Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install

# Or install via Homebrew
brew install gcc

# Verify installation
gcc --version
```

### On Windows
```bash
# Option 1: MinGW-w64
# Download from mingw-w64.org and add to PATH

# Option 2: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
# Install Ubuntu from Microsoft Store
# Then follow Linux instructions

# Verify installation
gcc --version
```

## Installing GDB (GNU Debugger)

GDB is essential for debugging C programs.

```bash
# Linux
sudo apt install gdb  # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo dnf install gdb  # Fedora

# macOS
brew install gdb

# Windows (MinGW)
# Included with MinGW-w64

# Verify installation
gdb --version
```

## Installing clang-format

clang-format automatically formats your C code to maintain consistency.

```bash
# Linux
sudo apt install clang-format  # Ubuntu/Debian

# macOS
brew install clang-format

# Windows
# Download from LLVM releases or use chocolatey
choco install llvm

# Verify installation
clang-format --version
```

## Your First C Program

Let's verify everything works by compiling and running a simple program.

Create a file called `hello.c`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello, C Programming!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run:

```bash
# Compile
gcc -o hello hello.c

# Run (Linux/macOS)
./hello

# Run (Windows)
hello.exe
```

Expected output:
```
Hello, C Programming!
```

## Recommended IDEs and Editors

- **VS Code** with C/C++ extension - Most popular, excellent tooling
- **CLion** (JetBrains) - Professional IDE with great debugging
- **Code::Blocks** - Free, beginner-friendly
- **Vim/Neovim** - Lightweight, for experienced users
- **Emacs** - Highly customizable

## Key Takeaways

- GCC is the standard C compiler we'll use throughout this course
- GDB is your debugging companion for finding bugs
- clang-format keeps your code clean and consistent
- The compilation workflow is: write code → compile with gcc → run executable
- Always verify your tools are installed correctly before proceeding

## Practice Exercise

1. Install GCC, GDB, and clang-format on your system
2. Create and compile the "Hello, C Programming!" program
3. Verify the output matches expectations
4. Try running `gcc --version`, `gdb --version`, and `clang-format --version` to confirm all tools are ready
