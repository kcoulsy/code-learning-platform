# TCP/IP Socket Programming

**Build networked applications from the ground up**

This course takes you from understanding sockets to building a production-ready echo server with multiple concurrency models. You'll learn how computers communicate over networks and build the foundation for HTTP servers, databases, and distributed systems.

## What You'll Learn

- **Phase 1**: Socket basics — what sockets are and how to create them
- **Phase 2**: Binding and listening — attaching to ports and queuing connections
- **Phase 3**: Accepting connections — the three-way handshake explained
- **Phase 4**: Data transfer — reading and writing on sockets
- **Phase 5**: Concurrency models — fork, threads, and select/poll

## Final Project

You'll build an **echo server** that:

- Listens on a configurable port
- Accepts multiple simultaneous clients
- Echoes back client messages
- Implements three concurrency models (fork, threads, select)

## Prerequisites

- Completion of [Learning C](/course/learning-c) or equivalent knowledge
- Comfortable with pointers, structs, and memory allocation
- Basic understanding of networking concepts (helpful but not required)

## Why This Matters

TCP sockets are the foundation of networked applications. Understanding how they work gives you:

- Insight into how the internet actually functions
- Foundation for building web servers, databases, and APIs
- Debugging skills for network-related issues
- Understanding of distributed systems architecture

Let's start by understanding what sockets are.
