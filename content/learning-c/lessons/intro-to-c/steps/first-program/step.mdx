# Your First C Program

Let's write the classic "Hello, World!" program and understand each part.

## The Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## Understanding Program Execution: A Mental Model

**Think of it like this:** A C program is like a recipe that the computer follows step-by-step. The `main()` function is the starting point - like "Step 1" in a recipe. The computer reads your code from top to bottom, executing each instruction in order.

**Visual representation:**
```
Your Code (hello.c) → Compiler (gcc) → Machine Code (hello.exe) → Computer Executes
```

**Key insight:** C doesn't run directly. It must be **compiled** (translated) into machine language first. This is different from languages like Python that run immediately.

## Breaking It Down (Line by Line)

### `#include <stdio.h>`
This is a **preprocessor directive** that includes the Standard Input/Output library.

**What it really does:**
- Runs *before* compilation begins
- Copies the contents of `stdio.h` (standard input/output header) into your program
- Gives you access to functions like `printf()` and `scanf()`
- The `#` symbol marks preprocessor commands (not regular C code)

**Think of it as:** Including a toolkit. Without `#include <stdio.h>`, your program won't know what `printf()` is, and compilation will fail.

### `int main()`
Every C program **must** have a `main()` function. This is where program execution begins.

**Breaking it down:**
- `int` = The function returns an integer value
- `main` = The special name the operating system looks for
- `()` = Parameters (empty here, but could have `int argc, char *argv[]`)

**What happens under the hood:**
1. Your operating system loads your program into memory
2. It looks for a function named `main()`
3. Execution starts at the first line inside `main()`
4. When `main()` ends, your program terminates

**Important:** Even if you write 100 functions, the program always starts at `main()`. Think of `main()` as the "front door" of your program.

### `printf("Hello, World!\n");`
This function prints text to the console (your terminal/command prompt).

**Breaking it down:**
- `printf` = "print formatted" (can print variables too, not just text)
- `"Hello, World!\n"` = A string literal (text in quotes)
- `\n` = Newline character (moves cursor to next line)
- `;` = Statement terminator (required after every statement in C)

**What you'll see:**
```
Hello, World!
```

**Why `\n` matters:** Without it, the next shell prompt appears right after your text:
```
Hello, World!$
```
With `\n`, you get:
```
Hello, World!
$
```

### `return 0;`
Returns 0 to the operating system to indicate the program ran successfully.

**Why this matters:**
- Return value is an **exit code** (also called exit status)
- `0` means "success" (no errors)
- Non-zero values (1, 2, 127, etc.) indicate errors
- Other programs and scripts can check this exit code

**Real-world example:** In shell scripts, you can check if a program succeeded:
```bash
./hello
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Program succeeded!"
fi
```

**Common convention:**
- `return 0;` = Success
- `return 1;` = General error
- Other codes = Specific error types (defined by you)

## Common First-Timer Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Forgetting the Semicolon

```c
printf("Hello, World!\n")   // ERROR: Missing semicolon!
return 0;
```

**Error you'll see:**
```
error: expected ';' before 'return'
```

**The fix:** Add the semicolon after every statement:
```c
printf("Hello, World!\n");  // Correct!
```

### Mistake 2: Forgetting `#include <stdio.h>`

```c
// Missing: #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");  // ERROR: printf not declared
    return 0;
}
```

**Error you'll see:**
```
warning: implicit declaration of function 'printf'
```

**The fix:** Always include `stdio.h` when using `printf()`, `scanf()`, or other I/O functions.

### Mistake 3: Wrong Main Function Signature

```c
void main() {           // Incorrect (old style)
    printf("Hello!\n");
}
```

**Better style:**
```c
int main(void) {        // Correct and explicit
    printf("Hello!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Why:** `main()` should return `int`. Using `void main()` is non-standard and won't work with all compilers.

### Mistake 4: Using Wrong Slash in `\n`

```c
printf("Hello, World!/n");  // WRONG: Forward slash
```

**The fix:** Use backslash `\n` (escape sequences always use backslash):
```c
printf("Hello, World!\n");  // Correct!
```

### Mistake 5: Mixing Up Quotes

```c
printf('Hello, World!\n');  // ERROR: Single quotes for strings
```

**Error you'll see:**
```
error: multi-character character constant
```

**The fix:**
- **Double quotes `"..."` for strings** (multiple characters)
- **Single quotes `'...'` for single characters** only (`'A'`, `'x'`, `'\n'`)

```c
printf("Hello, World!\n");  // Correct: Double quotes for string
char letter = 'A';          // Correct: Single quote for character
```

## Debugging: Error Messages You'll See

### Error: `undefined reference to 'main'`

**What it means:** The compiler can't find a `main()` function.

**Common causes:**
- You misspelled `main` (e.g., `Main`, `MAIN`, `mian`)
- Your `main()` is inside another function or has wrong syntax

**How to fix:** Make sure you have exactly `int main()` or `int main(void)` at the top level of your code.

### Error: `expected declaration or statement at end of input`

**What it means:** You're probably missing a closing brace `}`.

**Example:**
```c
int main() {
    printf("Hello!\n");
    return 0;
// Missing closing brace!
```

**How to fix:** Count your braces. Every `{` needs a matching `}`.

### Error: `fatal error: stdio.h: No such file or directory`

**What it means:** The compiler can't find the standard library headers.

**Common causes:**
- Compiler not installed correctly
- Using wrong compiler command

**How to fix:**
- Make sure GCC is installed: `gcc --version`
- Reinstall compiler if needed

### Warning: `control reaches end of non-void function`

**What it means:** You forgot `return 0;` at the end of `main()`.

**How to fix:** Always end `main()` with `return 0;`.

## Self-Check: Do You Understand?

Before moving on, make sure you can answer these:

1. **What does the `#include` directive do?**
   - It includes library code (like `stdio.h`) that provides functions like `printf()`

2. **Why must every C program have a `main()` function?**
   - It's the entry point - where execution begins

3. **What does `return 0;` mean?**
   - It returns an exit code to the OS; 0 means success

4. **What's the difference between `"A"` and `'A'`?**
   - `"A"` is a string (2 bytes: 'A' + '\0'), `'A'` is a character (1 byte)

5. **What happens if you forget the semicolon?**
   - Compilation error - C requires semicolons to end statements

6. **Why do we use `\n`?**
   - To print a newline (move to the next line)

7. **What is compilation?**
   - Translating your C code into machine code that the computer can execute

## Try It Yourself

1. Create a file called `hello.c`
2. Type the code above
3. Compile: `gcc -o hello hello.c`
4. Run: `./hello` (Linux/Mac) or `hello.exe` (Windows)

### Experiments to Try

1. **Remove `\n`** - What happens to the output?
2. **Change the return value** - Use `return 1;` and check the exit code (Linux/Mac: `echo $?`, Windows: `echo %errorlevel%`)
3. **Print multiple lines** - Add more `printf()` statements
4. **Introduce an error** - Forget a semicolon and read the error message carefully
5. **Use escape sequences** - Try `\t` (tab) or `\"` (quote) inside your string

## Key Takeaways

- C programs must be **compiled** before running
- Every program needs a `main()` function (the entry point)
- `#include <stdio.h>` provides I/O functions like `printf()`
- Statements end with semicolons `;`
- `return 0;` indicates success to the operating system
- Double quotes `"..."` for strings, single quotes `'...'` for characters
- Read error messages carefully - they tell you what's wrong and where
- The compilation process catches syntax errors before you run the program
