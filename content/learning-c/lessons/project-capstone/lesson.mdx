# Project 3: Shell or Custom Allocator Capstone

## Overview

This capstone project gives you the opportunity to apply your C programming skills to a substantial, real-world system programming challenge. You'll choose between two options:

**Option A: Unix Shell** - Build a command-line shell that can parse commands, launch processes, handle I/O redirection, and manage pipelines.

**Option B: Custom Memory Allocator** - Implement your own malloc and free functions with a free list, memory coalescing, and efficient allocation strategies.

Both projects will challenge you to integrate concepts you've learned throughout this course: pointers, dynamic memory, system calls, data structures, and low-level programming.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Design and implement a complex C program with multiple components
- Apply systems programming concepts (processes, memory management, system calls)
- Debug challenging issues in low-level code
- Write production-quality code with proper error handling
- Document and test a non-trivial software system

## Project Timeline

This project is designed to take 2-3 weeks of focused work:

- **Week 1**: Choose your project, design the architecture, implement core functionality
- **Week 2**: Add advanced features, handle edge cases, implement robust error handling
- **Week 3**: Testing, documentation, refinement, and presentation

## Getting Started

Begin by carefully reading through both project options in the first step. Consider:

- Your interests (command-line tools vs. memory management)
- Your comfort level with operating system concepts
- What you want to learn most deeply

Both projects are challenging and rewarding. Choose the one that excites you most!

## Deliverables

Your final project should include:

1. **Source Code**: Well-organized, commented C code
2. **Makefile**: Build system for compilation
3. **Test Suite**: Programs or scripts that demonstrate functionality
4. **Documentation**: README explaining design, usage, and implementation
5. **Reflection**: Brief write-up on challenges faced and lessons learned

Let's build something impressive!
