# Arithmetic Operators

C provides a rich set of arithmetic operators for performing mathematical calculations. These operators work similarly to basic math, but with some important differences you need to understand.

## The Basic Arithmetic Operators

C supports five fundamental arithmetic operators:

- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `%` Modulo (remainder)

## Addition, Subtraction, and Multiplication

These operators work as you'd expect from mathematics:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 15, b = 4;
    int sum, difference, product;

    sum = a + b;           // 19
    difference = a - b;    // 11
    product = a * b;       // 60

    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    printf("Difference: %d\n", difference);
    printf("Product: %d\n", product);

    return 0;
}
```

## Integer Division

Division in C behaves differently depending on the data types involved:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 17, y = 5;
    int int_result;
    float float_result;

    // Integer division truncates (rounds down)
    int_result = x / y;              // Result: 3 (not 3.4)

    // To get decimal result, cast to float
    float_result = (float)x / y;     // Result: 3.4

    printf("Integer division: %d / %d = %d\n", x, y, int_result);
    printf("Float division: %d / %d = %.2f\n", x, y, float_result);

    // Both operands as floats
    float a = 17.0, b = 5.0;
    printf("Float division: %.1f / %.1f = %.2f\n", a, b, a / b);

    return 0;
}
```

**Key Point**: When both operands are integers, division produces an integer result by truncating (discarding) the decimal part. This is not rounding - it always rounds toward zero.

## The Modulo Operator

The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder after division:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 17, b = 5;
    int remainder;

    remainder = a % b;    // 17 ÷ 5 = 3 remainder 2
    printf("%d %% %d = %d\n", a, b, remainder);

    // Practical use: Check if number is even or odd
    int number = 42;
    if (number % 2 == 0) {
        printf("%d is even\n", number);
    } else {
        printf("%d is odd\n", number);
    }

    // Check if number is divisible by another
    if (15 % 3 == 0) {
        printf("15 is divisible by 3\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Working with Mixed Types

When you mix data types in arithmetic expressions, C performs automatic type conversion:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 5;
    float f = 2.5;
    double d = 3.7;

    // int + float = float
    float result1 = i + f;        // 7.5

    // float + double = double
    double result2 = f + d;       // 6.2

    // int * float = float
    float result3 = i * f;        // 12.5

    printf("int + float = %.1f\n", result1);
    printf("float + double = %.1f\n", result2);
    printf("int * float = %.1f\n", result3);

    return 0;
}
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Integer Division Surprise

```c
// Wrong: Both operands are integers
int average = (5 + 8 + 12) / 3;    // Result: 8 (not 8.333)

// Correct: Cast to float first
float average = (5 + 8 + 12) / 3.0;  // Result: 8.333
```

### Pitfall 2: Modulo with Negative Numbers

```c
// The sign of the result matches the sign of the dividend (first operand)
int result1 = -17 % 5;    // -2 (not 3)
int result2 = 17 % -5;    // 2 (not -2)
```

### Pitfall 3: Division by Zero

```c
// This will crash your program!
int x = 10 / 0;    // Runtime error

// Always check before dividing
int divisor = 0;
if (divisor != 0) {
    int result = 10 / divisor;
} else {
    printf("Error: Cannot divide by zero\n");
}
```

## Exercises

1. Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle given its length and width.

2. Create a program that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula: C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9

3. Write a program that takes a three-digit number and prints each digit separately. (Hint: use division and modulo operations)

4. Calculate the average of five test scores, displaying the result with two decimal places.

5. Write a program that determines if a year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, except for century years, which must be divisible by 400.

## Key Takeaways

- C has five basic arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Integer division truncates the decimal part (doesn't round)
- Use type casting to get decimal results from integer division
- The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder after division
- Modulo is useful for checking divisibility and even/odd numbers
- Division by zero causes runtime errors - always validate your divisors
- Mixed-type arithmetic automatically converts to the "wider" type
- Understanding integer division is crucial for avoiding calculation errors
