# Build an HTTP Server

**Transform your TCP echo server into a real web server**

Now that you understand TCP sockets, it's time to build something the web actually uses: an HTTP server. You'll implement the HTTP protocol from scratch, parse requests, build responses, and serve files to browsers.

## What You'll Learn

- **Phase 1**: The HTTP protocol — requests, responses, and status codes
- **Phase 2**: Request parsing — extracting method, path, headers, and body
- **Phase 3**: Response building — crafting proper HTTP responses
- **Phase 4**: Routing — matching paths to handlers
- **Phase 5**: Static file serving — reading and serving files from disk

## Final Project

You'll build an **HTTP server** that:

- Listens on port 8080 (configurable)
- Serves static files from a `www/` directory
- Handles GET requests with proper HTTP/1.1 responses
- Returns appropriate status codes (200, 404, 400)
- Serves HTML, images, CSS, and JavaScript files

## Prerequisites

- Completion of [TCP/IP Socket Programming](/course/tcp-server)
- Understanding of file I/O in C
- Comfortable with string manipulation

## Why This Matters

HTTP servers power the web. Building one from scratch teaches you:

- How web frameworks actually work under the hood
- The practical details of HTTP that libraries abstract away
- Performance considerations for network applications
- How to debug web applications at the protocol level

This course bridges the gap between raw sockets and real-world web development.
