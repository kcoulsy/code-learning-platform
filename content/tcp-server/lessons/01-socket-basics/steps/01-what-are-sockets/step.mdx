# What Are Sockets?

Sockets are the fundamental abstraction for network communication. They provide a standardized way for programs to send and receive data across a network, regardless of the underlying hardware or protocol.

## The Socket Abstraction

Think of a socket like a telephone:

- **The socket itself** is like a telephone handset
- **The IP address** is like a phone number identifying which phone to call
- **The port number** is like an extension number to reach a specific person
- **The network** is like the telephone system connecting everything

When two programs want to communicate over a network, they each create a socket and then connect those sockets together.

## Socket Domains

Sockets can communicate using different "address families":

| Domain     | Purpose | Address Format                                   |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `AF_INET`  | IPv4    | 32-bit addresses like 192.168.1.1                |
| `AF_INET6` | IPv6    | 128-bit addresses like 2001:db8::1               |
| `AF_UNIX`  | Local   | Filesystem paths for inter-process communication |

We'll use `AF_INET` (IPv4) throughout this course.

## Socket Types

Within each domain, we can use different communication styles:

| Type          | Characteristics                           | Use Cases                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `SOCK_STREAM` | Sequential, reliable, connection-oriented | HTTP, SSH, email                      |
| `SOCK_DGRAM`  | No ordering, no reliability guarantee     | DNS, video streaming                  |
| `SOCK_RAW`    | Direct access to IP protocol              | Network diagnostics, custom protocols |

`SOCK_STREAM` over IPv4 corresponds to the TCP protocol.

## How TCP Works

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides reliable, ordered, error-checked delivery of data between applications. Key characteristics:

- **Connection-oriented**: Must establish connection before data flow
- **Reliable**: Data is guaranteed to arrive (or error is reported)
- **Ordered**: Messages arrive in the order sent
- **Flow control**: Prevents sender from overwhelming receiver
- **Congestion control**: Adapts to network conditions

This reliability comes at the cost of some overhead and latency compared to UDP.

## Your Turn

Try creating a socket and printing its file descriptor:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int main() {
    int fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    printf("Socket file descriptor: %d\n", fd);
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

What values do you see? What happens if you try invalid arguments?
