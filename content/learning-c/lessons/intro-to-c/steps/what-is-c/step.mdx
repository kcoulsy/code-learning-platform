# What is C?

C is a **general-purpose programming language** created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. It has been one of the most influential languages in computer science history.

## Why Learn C?

- **Foundation of modern programming**: Many languages like C++, Java, and Python have syntax inspired by C
- **System programming**: Operating systems, embedded systems, and device drivers are often written in C
- **Performance**: C gives you low-level access to memory and hardware
- **Portability**: C code can run on almost any platform

## Key Characteristics

```c
// C is a compiled language
// This is a simple C program

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

C is known for being:
- **Fast** - compiles to machine code
- **Flexible** - low-level memory access
- **Portable** - runs on many platforms
