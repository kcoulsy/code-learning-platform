# Your First C Program

Let's write the classic "Hello, World!" program and understand each part.

## The Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## Breaking It Down

### `#include <stdio.h>`
This is a **preprocessor directive** that includes the Standard Input/Output library. This gives us access to functions like `printf()`.

### `int main()`
Every C program must have a `main()` function. This is where program execution begins.
- `int` means the function returns an integer
- `main` is the function name
- `()` contains parameters (empty here)

### `printf("Hello, World!\n");`
This function prints text to the console.
- `\n` is a newline character
- The semicolon `;` ends the statement

### `return 0;`
Returns 0 to indicate the program ran successfully.

## Try It Yourself

1. Create a file called `hello.c`
2. Type the code above
3. Compile: `gcc -o hello hello.c`
4. Run: `./hello`
