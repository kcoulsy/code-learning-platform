# Dynamic Memory Management

Welcome to one of the most critical topics in C programming: dynamic memory management. Unlike many modern languages that handle memory automatically, C gives you direct control over memory allocation and deallocation. This power comes with significant responsibility.

## What You'll Learn

In this lesson, you'll master:

- **Stack vs Heap Memory**: Understanding the two primary memory regions and when to use each
- **Memory Allocation**: Using `malloc()`, `calloc()`, and `realloc()` to allocate memory dynamically
- **Memory Deallocation**: Properly freeing memory with `free()` to prevent leaks
- **Common Pitfalls**: Avoiding memory leaks, dangling pointers, and buffer overflows
- **Debugging Tools**: Using Valgrind to detect memory errors
- **Dynamic Data Structures**: Building flexible arrays and other dynamic structures

## Why This Matters

Dynamic memory management is essential for:

- Creating data structures whose size isn't known at compile time
- Building scalable applications that adapt to runtime requirements
- Managing large datasets efficiently
- Writing professional-grade C code
- Avoiding critical bugs like memory leaks and use-after-free errors

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, you should be comfortable with:

- Pointers and pointer arithmetic
- Arrays and their relationship to pointers
- Basic understanding of memory addresses

## Safety First

Memory management errors are among the most dangerous bugs in C programming. They can cause:

- Crashes and segmentation faults
- Security vulnerabilities
- Subtle corruption that's hard to debug
- Performance degradation

Throughout this lesson, we'll emphasize safe practices and show you how to use tools like Valgrind to catch errors early. **Always check allocation return values, always free what you allocate, and always test with memory debugging tools.**

Let's begin by understanding where your memory comes from!
