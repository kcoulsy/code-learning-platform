# Function Pointers and Callbacks

Function pointers are one of C's most powerful features, enabling flexible, extensible code through callbacks, plugin systems, and event-driven programming. While the syntax can be intimidating at first, function pointers are essential for professional C development.

## What You'll Learn

In this lesson, you will:

- Understand function pointers and their syntax
- Declare, assign, and call functions through pointers
- Use typedef to simplify function pointer syntax
- Implement callback patterns for event handling
- Work with the standard library (qsort, bsearch)
- Build state machines and dispatchers
- Create plugin architectures

## Why This Matters

Function pointers enable design patterns that would be impossible with regular functions:

- **Generic Algorithms**: qsort can sort any data type using custom comparison functions
- **Event Handling**: GUI libraries use callbacks to respond to user actions
- **Plugin Systems**: Applications can load and call functions dynamically
- **State Machines**: Elegant state transitions using function pointer tables
- **Dependency Injection**: Pass behavior as parameters rather than hardcoding

Real-world examples:
- Linux kernel uses function pointers extensively for device drivers and virtual file systems
- GUI frameworks (GTK, Qt) use callbacks for button clicks, timers, etc.
- Game engines use function pointers for AI behaviors and event systems
- Database engines use function pointers for pluggable storage backends

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, you should be comfortable with:
- Pointers and pointer arithmetic
- Functions and function prototypes
- Structs and typedef
- Basic data structures (arrays, linked lists)

## Lesson Structure

This lesson contains 2 comprehensive steps:

1. **Function Pointers** - Syntax, declaration, usage, and typedef for cleaner code
2. **Callback Functions** - Callback patterns, qsort, event handlers, and state machines

## Real-World Application

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Write generic, reusable algorithms
- Implement event-driven systems
- Create flexible APIs that accept behavior as parameters
- Build state machines for parsers and protocols
- Understand and use standard library functions like qsort and bsearch

Let's dive into function pointers!
