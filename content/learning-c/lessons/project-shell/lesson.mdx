# Project: Unix Shell

## Overview

This capstone project gives you the opportunity to apply your C programming skills to build a real Unix shell. You'll create an interactive command-line interface that can parse commands, launch processes, handle I/O redirection, and manage pipelines.

This project will challenge you to integrate concepts you've learned throughout this course: pointers, dynamic memory, system calls, data structures, and low-level programming.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Design and implement a complex C program with multiple components
- Apply systems programming concepts (processes, memory management, system calls)
- Debug challenging issues in low-level code
- Write production-quality code with proper error handling
- Document and test a non-trivial software system

## Project Timeline

This project is designed to take 2-3 weeks of focused work:

- **Week 1**: Design the architecture, implement core functionality
- **Week 2**: Add advanced features (redirection, pipelines, signals)
- **Week 3**: Testing, documentation, refinement, and presentation

## Getting Started

Begin with the Project Overview step to understand the requirements and set up your development environment.

## Deliverables

Your final project should include:

1. **Source Code**: Well-organized, commented C code
2. **Makefile**: Build system for compilation
3. **Test Suite**: Programs or scripts that demonstrate functionality
4. **Documentation**: README explaining design, usage, and implementation
5. **Reflection**: Brief write-up on challenges faced and lessons learned

Let's build something impressive!
