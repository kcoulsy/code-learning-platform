# Step 1: Project Specification

Before writing any code, successful projects start with clear requirements. In this step, you'll define what your contact book application should do and how it should behave.

## Overview

Writing a specification helps you:
- Clarify exactly what you're building
- Identify potential challenges early
- Create measurable success criteria
- Plan your development approach

## Core Requirements

Your contact book application must support these essential features:

### 1. Contact Management
- **Add Contact**: Create a new contact with multiple fields
- **List Contacts**: Display all contacts in a readable format
- **Search Contact**: Find contacts by name or other criteria
- **Delete Contact**: Remove a contact from the database

### 2. Data Persistence
- **Save to File**: Store all contacts to a file on disk
- **Load from File**: Automatically load contacts when the program starts
- **Data Integrity**: Handle file errors gracefully

### 3. User Interface
- **Menu System**: Clear, numbered menu options
- **Input Validation**: Handle invalid user input without crashing
- **User Feedback**: Confirm actions and display helpful messages

## Contact Data Fields

Each contact should store at least:
- **Name** (required, string up to 50 characters)
- **Phone Number** (optional, string up to 20 characters)
- **Email Address** (optional, string up to 50 characters)

**Design Question**: Should you use fixed-size arrays or dynamic strings? Consider the trade-offs.

## Functional Requirements

### Adding a Contact
```
Expected behavior:
1. Prompt user for name (required)
2. Prompt for phone number (optional, can skip)
3. Prompt for email (optional, can skip)
4. Validate that name is not empty
5. Add contact to the list
6. Display confirmation message
```

### Listing Contacts
```
Expected behavior:
1. Display total count of contacts
2. Show each contact with formatting:
   - Index number
   - Name
   - Phone (or "N/A" if empty)
   - Email (or "N/A" if empty)
3. Handle empty contact list gracefully
```

### Searching Contacts
```
Expected behavior:
1. Prompt for search term
2. Search through contact names (case-insensitive)
3. Display matching contacts
4. Show "no results" message if no matches
```

### Deleting a Contact
```
Expected behavior:
1. Display numbered list of contacts
2. Prompt for contact number to delete
3. Confirm deletion with user
4. Remove contact and free memory
5. Display confirmation
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Handle at least 1000 contacts efficiently
- Menu operations should feel instant

### Reliability
- No memory leaks (verify with valgrind)
- Handle file I/O errors without crashing
- Gracefully handle full disk scenarios

### Usability
- Clear instructions and prompts
- Consistent formatting
- Easy to navigate menu system

## Technical Constraints

- **Language**: C (C99 or later)
- **Platform**: Should work on Linux/Unix and Windows
- **Dependencies**: Standard C library only (stdio, stdlib, string)
- **File Format**: Plain text (human-readable preferred)

## Success Criteria

Your project is complete when:
- [ ] All core features work correctly
- [ ] Data persists between program runs
- [ ] No memory leaks (valgrind clean)
- [ ] Input validation prevents crashes
- [ ] Code is organized into separate modules
- [ ] User can complete all operations without errors

## Optional Enhancements

Consider adding these features if time permits:
- Sort contacts alphabetically
- Edit existing contacts
- Multiple phone numbers per contact
- Search by phone or email
- Export contacts to CSV
- Import contacts from file
- Birthday reminders

## Your Task

**Write Your Own Specification Document**

Create a text file named `SPECIFICATION.txt` in your project directory that includes:

1. **Project Overview**: Brief description in your own words
2. **Feature List**: The specific features you'll implement
3. **Data Fields**: What information each contact will store
4. **File Format**: Decide how you'll store data (CSV, JSON-like, custom format)
5. **Success Criteria**: Your personal checklist for completion

**Example Format Decision:**
```
File Format Choice: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

Reasoning:
- Human-readable for debugging
- Easy to parse in C
- Compatible with spreadsheet software
- Simple format: name,phone,email

Example line:
John Doe,555-1234,john@example.com
```

## Reflection Questions

Before moving to the next step, consider:

1. **What is the maximum number of contacts your program should handle?** This affects your data structure choice.

2. **What happens if the contacts file is corrupted?** Plan your error handling strategy.

3. **Should the program auto-save after every change, or only on exit?** Each has trade-offs.

4. **How will you handle special characters in names (apostrophes, hyphens)?** This affects parsing.

5. **What makes a good user experience for a CLI application?** Think about real-world usage.

## Milestone Checklist

- [ ] Written SPECIFICATION.txt with all required sections
- [ ] Decided on data fields for contacts
- [ ] Chosen a file format for persistence
- [ ] Listed all menu options your UI will have
- [ ] Identified potential error scenarios
- [ ] Ready to move to design phase

## Next Step

Once you have a clear specification, you're ready for **Step 2: Design Phase**, where you'll plan the architecture and module structure of your application.

**Pro Tip**: Real software projects spend significant time on requirements. A clear specification now will save hours of confusion later!
