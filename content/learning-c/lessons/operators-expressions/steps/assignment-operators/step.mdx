# Assignment Operators

Assignment operators allow you to store values in variables. While the basic assignment operator `=` is straightforward, C provides several compound assignment operators and increment/decrement operators that make your code more concise and efficient.

## Basic Assignment

The assignment operator `=` stores a value in a variable:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x;

    x = 10;              // Assign 10 to x
    printf("x = %d\n", x);

    x = 20;              // Reassign x to 20
    printf("x = %d\n", x);

    int y = x;           // Assign x's value to y
    printf("y = %d\n", y);

    // Assignment returns a value, so you can chain assignments
    int a, b, c;
    a = b = c = 5;       // All three variables become 5
    printf("a = %d, b = %d, c = %d\n", a, b, c);

    return 0;
}
```

## Compound Assignment Operators

Compound assignment operators combine an arithmetic operation with assignment, providing a shorter way to update variables:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 10;

    // Addition assignment
    x += 5;       // Equivalent to: x = x + 5
    printf("After x += 5: %d\n", x);    // 15

    // Subtraction assignment
    x -= 3;       // Equivalent to: x = x - 3
    printf("After x -= 3: %d\n", x);    // 12

    // Multiplication assignment
    x *= 2;       // Equivalent to: x = x * 2
    printf("After x *= 2: %d\n", x);    // 24

    // Division assignment
    x /= 4;       // Equivalent to: x = x / 4
    printf("After x /= 4: %d\n", x);    // 6

    // Modulo assignment
    x %= 4;       // Equivalent to: x = x % 4
    printf("After x %%= 4: %d\n", x);   // 2

    return 0;
}
```

## Increment and Decrement Operators

The increment `++` and decrement `--` operators increase or decrease a variable by 1. They come in two forms: prefix and postfix.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 5;

    // Postfix increment: use current value, then increment
    printf("x = %d\n", x);       // 5
    printf("x++ = %d\n", x++);   // Prints 5, then x becomes 6
    printf("x = %d\n", x);       // 6

    // Prefix increment: increment first, then use new value
    printf("++x = %d\n", ++x);   // x becomes 7, then prints 7
    printf("x = %d\n", x);       // 7

    // Postfix decrement
    printf("x-- = %d\n", x--);   // Prints 7, then x becomes 6
    printf("x = %d\n", x);       // 6

    // Prefix decrement
    printf("--x = %d\n", --x);   // x becomes 5, then prints 5
    printf("x = %d\n", x);       // 5

    return 0;
}
```

## Prefix vs Postfix: The Difference

Understanding the difference between prefix and postfix is crucial:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 10;
    int result1, result2;

    // Postfix: use current value, then increment
    result1 = a++;
    printf("Postfix: result1 = %d, a = %d\n", result1, a);  // result1 = 10, a = 11

    // Prefix: increment first, then use new value
    result2 = ++b;
    printf("Prefix: result2 = %d, b = %d\n", result2, b);   // result2 = 11, b = 11

    // Practical example: loop counters
    int i = 0;
    printf("Loop with postfix: ");
    while (i < 5) {
        printf("%d ", i++);    // Prints 0 1 2 3 4
    }
    printf("\n");

    int j = 0;
    printf("Loop with prefix: ");
    while (j < 5) {
        printf("%d ", ++j);    // Prints 1 2 3 4 5
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

## Practical Applications

Here are some common patterns using assignment operators:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Accumulating a sum
    int sum = 0;
    sum += 10;
    sum += 20;
    sum += 30;
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);    // 60

    // Doubling a value repeatedly
    int value = 1;
    value *= 2;    // 2
    value *= 2;    // 4
    value *= 2;    // 8
    printf("Value after tripling: %d\n", value);

    // Counting items
    int count = 0;
    count++;    // Found one item
    count++;    // Found another
    count++;    // And another
    printf("Total items: %d\n", count);    // 3

    // Applying a discount
    float price = 100.0;
    price *= 0.9;    // 10% discount (multiply by 0.9)
    printf("Price after discount: $%.2f\n", price);    // $90.00

    return 0;
}
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Confusing = with ==

```c
int x = 5;

// Wrong: This is assignment, not comparison!
if (x = 10) {    // Always true, and x is now 10!
    printf("This will always execute\n");
}

// Correct: Use == for comparison
if (x == 10) {
    printf("x is equal to 10\n");
}
```

### Pitfall 2: Multiple Increment/Decrement Operations

```c
int x = 5;

// Undefined behavior - don't do this!
int result = x++ + x++;    // Result is unpredictable

// Correct: Use separate statements
x++;
x++;
int result = x;
```

### Pitfall 3: Using Increment in Complex Expressions

```c
int i = 5;

// Confusing and potentially undefined
int result = i++ + ++i * i--;    // Don't do this!

// Clear and correct: Break it into steps
int result = i * 2;
i++;
```

### Pitfall 4: Forgetting Operator Order in Compound Assignment

```c
int x = 10;

// This might not do what you expect
x *= 2 + 3;    // x = x * (2 + 3) = 50, not x = x * 2 + 3 = 23

// Be explicit with parentheses if needed
x = x * 2 + 3;    // 23
```

## Exercises

1. Write a program that starts with a variable set to 100 and uses compound assignment operators to: add 50, subtract 30, multiply by 2, divide by 4, and find the remainder when divided by 7. Print the result after each operation.

2. Create a simple counter program that increments a variable 10 times using a loop and prints each value.

3. Write a program that demonstrates the difference between prefix and postfix increment by using both in expressions and showing the results.

4. Create a program that calculates compound interest. Start with $1000, apply 5% interest using `*= 1.05` for 5 years, and print the final amount.

5. Write a program that swaps two variables without using a third variable. (Hint: use compound assignment operators with addition and subtraction)

## Key Takeaways

- The basic assignment operator `=` stores values in variables
- Compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`) combine arithmetic with assignment
- Compound operators are more concise and often more efficient than separate operations
- Increment `++` adds 1, decrement `--` subtracts 1
- Postfix (`x++`) uses the current value, then increments
- Prefix (`++x`) increments first, then uses the new value
- In simple statements, prefix and postfix produce the same final result
- Avoid using increment/decrement operators in complex expressions
- Assignment returns a value, allowing chained assignments
- Don't confuse `=` (assignment) with `==` (comparison)
- Keep expressions simple and readable - clarity beats cleverness
