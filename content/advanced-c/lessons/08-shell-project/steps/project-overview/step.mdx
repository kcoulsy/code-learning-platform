# Project Overview: Unix Shell

## Introduction

Welcome to the Unix Shell project! In this capstone project, you'll build a command-line shell similar to bash or sh. This is one of the most iconic systems programming projects you can undertake - understanding how shells work gives you deep insight into operating systems.

## What You'll Build

A command-line shell capable of:

- Reading and parsing user commands
- Executing programs with arguments
- Handling built-in commands (cd, exit, etc.)
- Managing I/O redirection (`>`, `<`, `>>`)
- Creating pipelines (`|`)
- Running background processes (`&`)
- Managing environment variables

## Example Interaction

```bash
myshell> ls -la | grep ".c" > c_files.txt
myshell> cat c_files.txt
myshell> gcc program.c -o program && ./program
myshell> export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
myshell> cd projects
myshell> make &
[1] 12345
myshell> exit
```

## Core Concepts

### Systems Programming

- Process creation with `fork()` and `exec()`
- Process management and waiting
- Signal handling (SIGINT, SIGCHLD)
- File descriptor manipulation

### Parsing and Data Structures

- Tokenizing command strings
- Building command structures
- Handling special characters and quotes

## Difficulty Assessment

### Moderate Challenges

- String parsing (handling quotes, special characters)
- Process lifecycle management
- Implementing built-in commands

### Advanced Challenges

- I/O redirection and pipes
- Signal handling without race conditions
- Background process tracking
- Complex command parsing (quoted strings, escaping)

## Time Estimate

- **Basic shell (read-parse-execute)**: 1 week
- **Built-ins and process management**: 3-4 days
- **I/O redirection and pipes**: 3-4 days
- **Polish and testing**: 2-3 days

**Total**: 2-3 weeks

## Learning Outcomes

You'll gain deep understanding of:

- How shells work internally
- Unix process model
- System call interfaces
- Parsing and tokenization
- Asynchronous event handling

## Getting Started

### Set Up Your Development Environment

1. Create your project directory
2. Set up a Makefile for building
3. Initialize version control (git)
4. Start with the main REPL loop

### First Steps

1. Read through all project steps to understand the scope
2. Design your architecture before coding
3. Set up a testing strategy early
4. Use version control from the beginning

## Resources

### General C Programming

- man pages (man 2 for system calls, man 3 for library functions)
- gdb for debugging
- valgrind for memory checking

### Shell-Specific

- "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment" by Stevens
- man pages: fork, exec, pipe, dup2, waitpid
- Study existing shells (bash source code)

## Next Steps

Proceed to the Shell Design step where you'll learn about the architecture and plan your implementation!
