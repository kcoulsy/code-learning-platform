# Advanced C Programming

**Professional-grade C mastery for serious programmers**

This course takes you beyond the fundamentals into the advanced concepts that separate junior from senior C programmers. You'll learn how the C preprocessor works, master essential debugging tools, understand the C memory model, and learn to read and write real-world C codebases.

## What You'll Learn

- **Phase 8**: The C Preprocessor & Build Model — macros, conditional compilation, header guards
- **Phase 9**: Debugging, Tooling & Inspection — gdb, sanitizers, compiler warnings, optimization
- **Phase 10**: The C Standard Library — internals of string.h, stdlib.h, stdio.h, errno patterns
- **Phase 11**: Undefined Behavior & Memory Model — strict aliasing, sequence points, pointer lifetime
- **Phase 12**: Reading & Writing Real C Code — style patterns, defensive idioms, API design
- **Project 1**: Custom Memory Allocator — implement malloc/free with alignment and debugging
- **Project 2**: Data Structure Library — generic containers with custom allocator support

## Prerequisites

**Required**: Completion of [Learning C](/course/learning-c) or equivalent knowledge

You should be comfortable with:

- Pointers and pointer arithmetic
- Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free)
- Structs and modular programming
- Basic compilation and debugging

## Why This Matters

Most C programmers stop at the basics. This course covers the advanced concepts that:

- Prevent subtle bugs that hide in production
- Let you debug complex issues without guesswork
- Enable you to read and contribute to real C codebases
- Separate working code from _professional_ code
- Build confidence that your code is correct and portable

## Course Structure

This course includes **5 phases** and **2 projects** with approximately **58 steps** of comprehensive content. Each step includes:

- Clear learning objectives
- Code examples showing both good and bad patterns
- Practice exercises
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Real-world context from major C projects

## Projects

You'll build two substantial projects:

1. **Memory Allocator** — Implement your own malloc/free with alignment tracking, debugging features, and performance benchmarking
2. **Data Structure Library** — Create generic containers (vector, hash map) with type-safe APIs, custom allocator support, and comprehensive testing

Let's dive into professional C programming.
