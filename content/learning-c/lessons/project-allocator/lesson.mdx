# Project: Custom Memory Allocator

## Overview

This capstone project gives you the opportunity to apply your C programming skills to build a custom memory allocator. You'll implement your own versions of `malloc()`, `free()`, `realloc()`, and `calloc()` with a free list, memory coalescing, and efficient allocation strategies.

This project will challenge you to understand memory management at the deepest level and master pointer manipulation, data structures, and algorithms.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Design and implement a complex C library with multiple components
- Understand how memory allocators work internally
- Master pointer arithmetic and memory manipulation
- Implement efficient data structures for memory management
- Debug challenging memory-related issues
- Write production-quality code with proper error handling

## Project Timeline

This project is designed to take 2-3 weeks of focused work:

- **Week 1**: Design the architecture, implement basic malloc/free
- **Week 2**: Add coalescing, splitting, advanced features
- **Week 3**: Testing, documentation, refinement, and presentation

## Getting Started

Begin with the Project Overview step to understand the requirements and set up your development environment.

## Deliverables

Your final project should include:

1. **Source Code**: Well-organized, commented C library code
2. **Makefile**: Build system for compilation
3. **Test Suite**: Programs that demonstrate functionality
4. **Documentation**: README explaining design, usage, and implementation
5. **Reflection**: Brief write-up on challenges faced and lessons learned

Let's build something impressive!
