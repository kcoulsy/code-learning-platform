# Systems Programming and File I/O

Welcome to the world of systems programming in C. This lesson explores how C programs interact with the operating system to perform file operations, create processes, and enable communication between programs.

## What You'll Learn

In this lesson, you'll discover:

- **File I/O Operations**: Opening, reading, writing, and closing files using standard C library functions
- **File Positioning**: Moving around in files with seek operations and tracking file positions
- **Binary vs Text Files**: Understanding the differences and when to use each approach
- **POSIX System Calls**: Creating and managing processes with fork, exec, and wait
- **Inter-Process Communication**: Using pipes to communicate between processes

## Why This Matters

Systems programming is where C truly shines. Whether you're building command-line tools, servers, embedded systems, or operating system components, understanding file I/O and process management is essential. These skills form the foundation of:

- Building robust applications that persist data
- Creating multi-process architectures
- Implementing communication protocols
- Working with system resources efficiently

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, you should be comfortable with:

- Pointers and memory management
- Strings and arrays
- Error handling patterns
- Basic C standard library usage

Let's dive into the powerful world of systems programming!
