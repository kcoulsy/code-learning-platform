# Systems Programming

Systems programming takes you beyond standard library functions into the world of operating system APIs. You'll learn how to interact with processes, manage inter-process communication, and leverage POSIX APIs for powerful system-level programming.

## What You'll Learn

In this lesson, you will:

- Understand POSIX standards and APIs
- Work with process management (fork, exec, wait)
- Implement inter-process communication (pipes, FIFOs, signals)
- Handle file descriptors at the system level
- Build programs that interact with the operating system

## Why This Matters

Systems programming is essential for:

- **Building system utilities**: Tools like shells, daemons, and system monitors
- **Process management**: Creating and controlling child processes
- **IPC mechanisms**: Communication between separate programs
- **Performance**: Understanding low-level operations for optimization
- **Understanding Unix/Linux**: How the OS actually works under the hood

Real-world applications:
- Shells (bash, zsh) use fork/exec and pipes
- Web servers manage multiple processes
- Build systems coordinate compilation processes
- System daemons communicate via IPC

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, you should be comfortable with:
- File I/O basics (fopen, fread, fwrite)
- Error handling with errno
- Pointers and dynamic memory
- Function pointers (for signal handlers)

## Lesson Structure

This lesson contains 2 comprehensive steps:

1. **POSIX Basics** - Process management, fork, exec, wait, and POSIX standards
2. **Pipes and IPC** - Inter-process communication using pipes, FIFOs, and signals

## Real-World Application

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Create and manage child processes
- Build pipelines like shell commands (`ls | grep | sort`)
- Implement client-server communication
- Handle signals for graceful shutdown
- Build system-level tools and utilities
