# Operators and Expressions

Operators are the building blocks of C programming, allowing you to perform calculations, make comparisons, and manipulate data. Understanding how operators work and how they combine into expressions is essential for writing effective C code.

## What You'll Learn

In this lesson, you'll explore:

- **Arithmetic operators** for mathematical calculations
- **Assignment operators** for updating variables efficiently
- **Relational and logical operators** for decision making
- **Operator precedence** to understand evaluation order
- **Complex expressions** combining multiple operators

## Why This Matters

Operators are fundamental to every C program. Whether you're calculating values, comparing data, or controlling program flow, you'll use operators constantly. Mastering them now will make you a more confident and capable programmer.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, you should:
- Understand variables and data types
- Know how to declare and initialize variables
- Be familiar with basic input/output using printf and scanf

Let's dive into the world of C operators and learn how to build powerful expressions!
